Threading currently uses modified ofxRuiThread modified slightly to work with OF 007

NOTES/TO-DOS
ofxRuiThread probably is not needed but has made threading much simpler for me
Incorporation of ofxMidi?
Has not been tested with more than 1 port 
Nice writeup on setting up a virtual midi port on a Mac (works well with GarageBand)
